WBS:

    Get config values from input
    convert the String to 2D array
    Get passengers count from input
    create the layout of the plane
    Craete seats with the created layout
    Then assign the seats to the passengers with the given order and seat type
    First we need to fill from first row(left to right)
      First AISLE
      Second WINDOW
      Third MIDDLE

    print the layout with passenger number and seat type
